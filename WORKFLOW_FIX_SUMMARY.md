# ðŸ”§ Continuous Publishing Workflow Fix

## Problem Found

The workflow was failing during the version bump step because it was trying to use:
```bash
yarn workspaces foreach --all version patch
```

This isn't a valid Yarn command - Yarn doesn't have a built-in `version` command for workspaces.

## Solution Applied

Updated the workflow to:
1. Read the current version from package.json
2. Calculate the new version based on commit type (major/minor/patch)
3. Use `npm version` to update each package individually

## What Happens Next

The workflow has been fixed and pushed. It should now:

1. âœ… Run automatically (triggered by the workflow file change)
2. âœ… Properly bump versions based on commit messages
3. âœ… Publish to npm and PyPI registries

## Monitor Progress

Check the workflow status at:
https://github.com/GaryOcean428/monkey-coder/actions/workflows/continuous-publish.yml

The latest run should show:
- Commit: "fix: correct npm version bumping in continuous publish workflow"
- Expected version bump: patch (1.1.0 â†’ 1.1.1)

## Package Versions

Current versions:
- `monkey-coder-cli`: 1.1.0
- `monkey-coder-sdk`: 1.0.0

After successful publish:
- `monkey-coder-cli`: 1.1.1
- `monkey-coder-sdk`: 1.0.1

## Installation

Once published, you can install:
```bash
npm install -g monkey-coder-cli
npm install monkey-coder-sdk
```

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for any errors
2. Verify NPM_ACCESS_TOKEN has publish permissions
3. Ensure the token can publish to unscoped packages

- ✅ Included railpack.json configuration details
- ✅ Added troubleshooting section
- ✅ Added security and monitoring information

**docs/README.md:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation index
- ✅ Organized documentation by category
- ✅ Added references to all key configuration files

### 4. Preserved Critical Files

- ✅ **MODEL_MANIFEST.md** - Kept unchanged as requested
- ✅ **yarn-workspace-optimizations.md** - Valuable Yarn optimization reference
- ✅ **railway-deployment-guide.md** - Railway-specific optimizations
- ✅ **troubleshooting-guide.md** - Important troubleshooting reference

## Best Practices Enforced

### Railway/Railpack
- Single-service deployment architecture
- Unified Python 3.13 + Node.js 20 runtime
- FastAPI serving Next.js static assets
- Proper environment variable configuration

### Yarn 4.9.2
- Global cache enabled (30-50% faster installs)
- Hardlinks for node_modules optimization
- Workspace constraints enforcement
- Zero vulnerabilities with security auditing
- All internal dependencies use `workspace:*` protocol

### Next.js 15.2.3
- Static export configuration for Railway deployment
- Proper build commands in railpack.json
- Security updates from 15.0.3 to 15.2.3

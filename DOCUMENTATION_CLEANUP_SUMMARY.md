## Best Practices Enforced

### Railway/Railpack
- Single-service deployment architecture
- Unified Python 3.13 + Node.js 20 runtime
- FastAPI serving Next.js static assets
- Proper environment variable configuration

### Yarn 4.9.2
- Global cache enabled (30-50% faster installs)
- Hardlinks for node_modules optimization
- Workspace constraints enforcement
- Zero vulnerabilities with security auditing
- All internal dependencies use `workspace:*` protocol

### Next.js 15.2.3
- Static export configuration for Railway deployment
- Proper build commands in railpack.json
- Security updates from 15.0.3 to 15.2.3

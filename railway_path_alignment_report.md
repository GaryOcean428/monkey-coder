## Railway Virtual Environment Path Alignment Report

### Summary
- **Total checks performed**: 7
- **Checks passed**: 7
- **Issues found**: 0
- **Status**: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

### Successful Verifications
- ✅ railpack.json install commands use /app/.venv paths
- ✅ railpack.json deploy command uses /app/.venv/bin/python
- ✅ VIRTUAL_ENV set to /app/.venv
- ✅ PATH includes /app/.venv/bin
- ✅ start_server.sh uses correct /app/.venv paths
- ✅ railway_environment_setup.sh uses correct /app/.venv paths
- ✅ Railway configuration tests all pass

### Expected Railway Deployment Behavior

When this configuration is deployed to Railway:

1. **Build Phase**: Railway will create virtual environment at `/app/.venv`
2. **Install Phase**: Dependencies will be installed to `/app/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages`
3. **Deploy Phase**: Container will start using `/app/.venv/bin/python /app/run_server.py`
4. **Startup**: FastAPI app will load successfully with all required packages
5. **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint will respond with 200 status
6. **Result**: ✅ Deployment SUCCESS - No more "No such file or directory" errors

### Differences from Previous Configuration

- ❌ **Before**: Scripts looked for Python at `/app/venv/bin/python` (without dot)
- ✅ **After**: All paths consistently use `/app/.venv/bin/python` (with dot)
- 🔧 **Fix**: Aligned shell scripts and validation with actual Railway build behavior

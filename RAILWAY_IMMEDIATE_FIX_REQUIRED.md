# RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT IMMEDIATE FIX GUIDE

## Current Status: VALIDATED ✅

The Railway deployment at https://coder.fastmonkey.au is currently showing FastAPI documentation instead of the frontend application. This has been confirmed through automated validation.

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ✅

The frontend static files are not being generated because required environment variables are missing from the Railway deployment configuration.

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED ⚡

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard

Go to Railway Dashboard → monkey-coder service → Variables tab and add these variables:

```bash
# CRITICAL FRONTEND VARIABLES
NEXT_OUTPUT_EXPORT=true
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://coder.fastmonkey.au
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://coder.fastmonkey.au
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://coder.fastmonkey.au
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# SECURITY (Generate new values for production)
JWT_SECRET_KEY=QwfZ4DUMAXpQIm010ntVFsiIh9T9Nlxf
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=52TLtnB8u95dfcfnqwsAfJP88e6NZkoO

# ENVIRONMENT
PYTHON_ENV=production
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# AI PROVIDERS (Replace with real API keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_real_openai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_real_anthropic_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_real_google_key_here
```

### Step 2: Verify Build Configuration

1. In Railway service settings → Build tab
2. Ensure "Build Method" is set to "Railpack" (not Nixpacks)
3. The railpack.json file is already configured correctly

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "Redeploy" 
3. Monitor build logs for successful frontend export

## AUTOMATED FIXES APPLIED ✅

The following fixes have been implemented in the repository:

- Development tools setup
- Dependencies installed
- Frontend built via workspace export

## ALTERNATIVE QUICK FIX

If environment variable setup doesn't work immediately, you can:

1. Change Railway start command to: `node run_unified.js`
2. This runs Next.js server directly instead of static export
3. Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## VERIFICATION

After fixing, verify at https://coder.fastmonkey.au:
- Should show Monkey Coder frontend (not API docs)
- Static assets should load from /_next/ paths
- API should remain accessible at /api/v1/ endpoints

## EMERGENCY CONTACT

If issues persist, run the emergency fix script on the Railway service:
```bash
chmod +x railway_frontend_fix.sh
./railway_frontend_fix.sh
```

  - Updated API key configuration with migration notes

#### 2. `/demo/artifacts/app.py`

- **Changes**:

  - Updated API key configuration with migration notes

#### 3. `/demo/artifacts/requirements.in`

  - Added migration note to use qwen-agent instead

#### 4. `/demo/artifacts/requirements.txt`

#### 5. `/packages/core/pyproject.toml`

- **Changes**:

  - Added migration note to use qwen-agent instead

#### 6. `/packages/core/monkey_coder/providers/__init__.py`

    `https://api.qwen.com/v1`

### Remaining References (Intentional)

The following references remain as comments with migration guidance:

- `demo/artifacts/requirements.in:1` - Comment explaining removal
- `packages/core/pyproject.toml:35` - Comment explaining removal

### Verification

✅ No active imports or dependencies on dashscope remain  
✅ No references to "alibabacloud-dashscope" found  
✅ All demo files updated with migration notes  
✅ Core package dependencies cleaned up  
✅ Provider configuration updated to use standard API endpoint

### Impact

- Demo applications will need to be updated to use qwen-agent or compatible API client
- Core package no longer depends on legacy dashscope package
- Provider configuration now uses standard Qwen API endpoint
- No risk of accidental use of incorrect package names

### Next Steps

If these demo applications need to be functional:

1. Install qwen-agent: `pip install qwen-agent`
2. Update import statements to use qwen-agent APIs
3. Update API configuration to match qwen-agent requirements
4. Test functionality with new API client

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All bad package name references have been successfully removed or replaced to avoid future
confusion.

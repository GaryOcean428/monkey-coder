## 🎯 Executive Summary

Successfully completed PR #130 continuation work, addressing all critical workflow failures and enforcing Railway deployment standards across the codebase. Fixed 4 critical Python syntax errors, synchronized dependencies, and updated all agent instruction files to reflect established patterns from past PRs (#126, #128).

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes

#### Python Syntax Errors (packages/core/monkey_coder/auth/enhanced_cookie_auth.py)
**Issues Found:**
- Lines 147, 158: Misaligned import statements (`from ..utils.time import utc_now`)
- Line 154: IndentationError causing module load failure
- Line 191-193: Additional indentation issues preventing compilation

**Resolution:**
- Fixed indentation of all import statements to proper method scope
- Ensured consistent 4-space indentation throughout the file
- Verified compilation with `python3 -m py_compile`

#### Missing Import (packages/core/monkey_coder/auth/enhanced_cookie_auth.py)
**Issue:**
- `datetime` module used throughout file but not imported
- Causing NameError at runtime: "name 'datetime' is not defined"

**Resolution:**
- Added `datetime` to imports: `from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone`
- Verified all datetime.now() and datetime.fromtimestamp() calls work correctly

#### Stripe Import Error (packages/core/monkey_coder/app/routes/stripe_checkout.py)
**Issue:**
- Incorrect import: `import stripe.error as stripe_error`
- Stripe SDK doesn't support this import pattern
- Causing ModuleNotFoundError: "No module named 'stripe.error'"

**Resolution:**
- Removed aliased import: `import stripe.error as stripe_error`
- Updated usage: `stripe_error.StripeError` → `stripe.error.StripeError`
- Verified stripe integration still functional

### 2. Dependency Synchronization

**Issue:**
- `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` out of sync (10+ packages)
- Drift affecting: anthropic, openai, google-genai, beautifulsoup4, cryptography, etc.

**Resolution:**
- Installed `uv` dependency manager: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Ran drift check: `./scripts/check_python_deps_sync.sh`
- Applied fixes: `./scripts/check_python_deps_sync.sh --fix`
- Verified synchronization: All versions now match pyproject.toml

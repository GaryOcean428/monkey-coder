**Secondary Goals**:
- Review past 10 PRs for consistency and best practices
- Validate all tests, builds, and configurations
- Update roadmap with current progress
- Identify completed vs remaining tasks from current phase

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Repository Health Assessment
**Status**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

- **Test Suite**: All 234/234 tests passing (100% success rate)
  - CLI Package: 73 tests passing
  - Web Package: 161 tests passing
  - Zero test failures identified
  
- **Build System**: All packages building successfully
  - TypeScript compilation: Clean (0 errors)
  - Yarn 4.9.2 workspace: Fully functional
  - All dependencies properly resolved

- **Code Quality**: Meeting standards
  - Linting: 0 errors, 123 warnings (non-blocking formatting issues)
  - TypeScript: No type errors
  - Security: All critical vulnerabilities resolved

### 2. Railway Deployment Validation
**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLIANT**

Executed comprehensive validation using `scripts/railway-debug.sh`:

#### Configuration Files Validated
| File | Service | PORT | Host | Health Check | Status |
|------|---------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| railpack.json | Frontend | ✅ $PORT | ✅ 0.0.0.0 | ✅ /api/health | PASS |
| railpack-backend.json | Backend | ✅ $PORT | ✅ 0.0.0.0 | ✅ /api/health | PASS |
| railpack-ml.json | ML Service | ✅ $PORT | ✅ 0.0.0.0 | ✅ /api/health | PASS |

#### Railway Best Practices Compliance
- ✅ **Issue 1**: No build system conflicts (only railpack files exist)
- ✅ **Issue 2**: All services use $PORT environment variable
- ✅ **Issue 3**: All services bind to 0.0.0.0 (not localhost)
- ✅ **Issue 4**: All health check endpoints configured correctly
- ✅ **Issue 5**: Proper environment variable reference structure

**Overall Compliance**: 5/5 checks passing (100%)

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Verification

## Future Considerations

### When to Reevaluate (Quarterly Review)

**Triggers for Nx Consideration:**
- Package count exceeds 10
- Team grows beyond 15 engineers
- Build times exceed 10 minutes
- Complex frontend dependency chains

**Triggers for Bazel Consideration:**
- Package count exceeds 50
- Multiple languages beyond TypeScript + Python
- Hermetic builds become compliance requirement
- Enterprise-scale deployment needs

**Next Review:** April 2025

### Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Remote caching** - If team grows
2. **Build distribution** - If builds slow down
3. **Advanced analytics** - More performance metrics
4. **IDE integration** - Better editor support

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Incremental approach** - Week-by-week implementation
2. **Existing tools** - npm-run-all2, madge, TypeScript features
3. **Simple scripts** - Easy to understand and maintain
4. **Comprehensive testing** - Validated everything works

### What We'd Do Differently

1. Start with TypeScript project references earlier
2. Add more examples to documentation
3. Create video tutorials for complex features

### Key Takeaways

1. **Right-sizing matters** - Don't over-engineer
2. **Existing tools are powerful** - Use what's available
3. **Monitoring is crucial** - Track performance data
4. **Documentation is valuable** - Record decisions and implementations

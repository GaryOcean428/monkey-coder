    - FIRST_SUCCESS: Fastest successful result
    - COMBINED: Aggregate multiple results
  - Thread management with timeout control (150ms default)
  - Performance tracking and metrics collection

- ✅ **Routing Strategies**
  - TASK_OPTIMIZED: Model selection based on task type
  - COST_EFFICIENT: Cheapest capable model selection
  - PERFORMANCE: Highest capability model selection
  - BALANCED: Balance between cost and performance
  - DQN_BASED: Learning-based selection
  - RANDOM: Testing strategy

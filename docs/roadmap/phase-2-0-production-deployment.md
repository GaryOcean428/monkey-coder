## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Production Architecture
```
Internet ‚Üí Railway Load Balancer ‚Üí FastAPI App ‚Üí Database
                                              ‚Üí AI Providers
                                              ‚Üí Monitoring
```

### Key Components
1. **Application Server**: FastAPI with Uvicorn workers
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
3. **Caching**: Redis for session and response caching
4. **Monitoring**: Sentry + Railway metrics + Custom dashboards
5. **Security**: JWT tokens, rate limiting, input validation

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Production Environment Variables
ENVIRONMENT=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
SENTRY_DSN=https://...
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secure-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>
# ... other provider keys
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: 95th percentile < 2 seconds
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (8.77 hours downtime/year)
- **Throughput**: Handle 1000 concurrent requests
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% error rate for valid requests

### Monitoring Metrics
- Application response times per endpoint
- Database query performance
- AI provider response times and error rates
- Memory and CPU utilization
- Active user sessions and API usage

## üö® Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **AI Provider Rate Limits**: Mitigation via provider rotation and caching
2. **Database Performance**: Connection pooling and query optimization
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Comprehensive security testing and monitoring
4. **Deployment Issues**: Staged deployment with rollback capability

### Contingency Plans

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**High Risk Areas:**
1. **AI Provider Dependency**: Rate limits, API changes, service outages
   - **Mitigation**: Multi-provider architecture, fallback mechanisms, caching
   - **Monitoring**: Provider health checks, automatic failover

2. **Quantum Routing Complexity**: Algorithm performance, edge cases
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, gradual rollout, fallback to simple routing
   - **Monitoring**: Performance metrics, success rates, user feedback

3. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Database performance, memory usage, concurrent users
   - **Mitigation**: Horizontal scaling, connection pooling, async operations
   - **Monitoring**: Performance dashboards, alerting, capacity planning

**Medium Risk Areas:**
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Authentication bypass, data leaks, injection attacks
   - **Mitigation**: Security audits, input validation, encryption
   - **Monitoring**: Security scanning, penetration testing, incident response

2. **Data Privacy Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, user data handling
   - **Mitigation**: Privacy by design, data minimization, user controls
   - **Monitoring**: Compliance audits, data flow mapping, user consent tracking

**Low Risk Areas:**
1. **UI/UX Issues**: Usability problems, design inconsistencies
   - **Mitigation**: User testing, design system, accessibility standards
   - **Monitoring**: User feedback, analytics, usability testing

### Business Risks

**Market Risks:**
- Competition from established AI coding platforms
- Changes in AI model pricing and availability
- Shifts in developer tool preferences
- Economic downturns affecting software spending

**Operational Risks:**
- Key team member departure
- Intellectual property disputes
- Regulatory changes affecting AI tools
- Supply chain disruptions (cloud providers)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Technical Mitigations:**

```python
# Example: Circuit breaker for AI provider failures
class AIProviderCircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN

    async def call_provider(self, provider_func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError("Provider circuit breaker is open")

        try:
            result = await provider_func(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == "HALF_OPEN":
                self.state = "CLOSED"
                self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = "OPEN"
                self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            raise e
```

### Business Mitigations
- Diversified revenue streams (API, enterprise, consulting)
- Strong intellectual property protection
- Multiple cloud provider relationships
- Comprehensive insurance coverage
- Emergency response procedures

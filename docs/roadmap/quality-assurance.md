## Quality Assurance

### QA Process Framework

**Pre-Development QA:**
- Requirements review and validation
- Technical design review
- Security threat modeling
- Performance baseline establishment
- Test planning and strategy definition

**Development QA:**
- Code review process (minimum 2 reviewers)
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Static code analysis and security scanning
- Performance testing and profiling
- Documentation review and validation

**Post-Development QA:**
- User acceptance testing
- Load testing and stress testing
- Security penetration testing
- Accessibility compliance testing
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Testing Standards

**Code Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit tests: Minimum 80% coverage
- Integration tests: Critical path coverage
- End-to-end tests: User workflow coverage
- Performance tests: Response time validation

**Testing Tools:**

```bash
# TypeScript/JavaScript testing
yarn test                    # Jest unit tests
yarn test:e2e               # Playwright end-to-end tests
yarn test:performance       # Performance benchmarking

# Python testing
Python -m pytest --cov=monkey_coder            # Unit tests with coverage
Python -m pytest --cov=monkey_coder --cov-report=HTML  # HTML coverage report
Python -m bandit -r monkey_coder               # Security testing
Python -m mypy monkey_coder                    # Type checking
```

**Quality Gates:**
1. **Code Review**: All changes require peer review
2. **Automated Tests**: All tests must pass
3. **Security Scan**: No high-severity vulnerabilities
4. **Performance**: No regression in response times
5. **Documentation**: All public APIs documented

### Security QA

**Security Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Authentication and authorization testing
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
- [ ] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- [ ] API rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Data encryption in transit and at REST
- [ ] Secrets management and rotation
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Penetration testing (quarterly)

**Security Tools Integration:**

```yaml
# Security scanning in CI/CD
security_scan:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Run Bandit security scan
      run: bandit -r packages/core/monkey_coder -f JSON -o bandit-report.JSON

    - name: Run npm audit
      run: yarn audit --audit-level moderate

    - name: Run Snyk security scan
      uses: snyk/actions/node@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}

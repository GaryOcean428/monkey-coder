- [ ] Performance metrics collection with real-time monitoring
- [ ] Analytics dashboard with quantum thread performance analysis
- [ ] Cache warming and smart invalidation strategies

### Q3 2025: Multi-Agent Orchestration & MCP Integration

###### Agent + MCP Integration

```python
class MCPEnabledOrchestrator:
    async def execute_with_mcp(self, task, agents, mcp_servers):
        """Execute task with MCP-enabled agents in quantum superposition"""


        # Connect to MCP servers
        mcp_connections = await self.connect_mcp_servers(mcp_servers)


        # Create variations with different MCP tool combinations
        variations = []
        for agent in agents:
            for mcp_combo in self.generate_mcp_combinations(mcp_servers):
                variation = agent.create_quantum_variation(
                    task=task,
                    mcp_tools=mcp_combo
                )
                variations.append(variation)


        # Execute all variations in parallel
        result = await self.quantum_manager.execute_quantum_task(
            variations,
            collapse_strategy=CollapseStrategy.BEST_SCORE
        )
```

###### User Experience Enhancement

```bash
$ monkey generate "Create a REST API with user auth"

🔌 Available MCP Servers:
✓ filesystem (access to project files)
✓ GitHub (repository operations)
✓ postgres (database operations)
□ browser (web access) - not configured

Select MCP servers to use:
> ✓ filesystem
  ✓ GitHub
  ✓ postgres

🤖 Agent Analysis with MCP tools:
- Architect Agent + filesystem: Analyze project structure ($0.05)
- Code Generator + GitHub: Find similar implementations ($0.15)
- Database Agent + postgres: Design schema ($0.10)

Estimated Total: $0.30

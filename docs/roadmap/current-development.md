### Post-Merge Update (2025-08-08)

- Quantum Routing Engine branch merged into main; conflicts resolved.
  - Preserved protected packages/core/monkey_coder/models.py from HEAD.
  - Normalized .gitignore and removed committed Next.js build artifacts (.next/, out/).
  - Integrated commits from copilot/fix-29 (DQN training pipeline, tests) and resolved overlaps in quantum modules.
  - Consolidated branches: only main remains locally and on origin.
- Workspace state
  - Yarn 4.9.2 install successful across workspaces.
  - ESLint v9 migration warnings for root/cli/sdk (missing eslint.config.js); web lints clean but suggests adding Next.js ESLint plugin.
  - Tests: web workspace lacks Jest/Vitest test runner; CLI has one failing expectation in **tests**/install.test.ts regarding CI log message; Python core installs editable and test infra is present.

#### Follow-ups Implemented (2025-08-08, later)

- P0 Testing and CI gate (Completed)
  - Web: Migrated to next/jest with jsdom; added jest.setup.ts and file mocks; fixed Vitest-based test to Jest with TS-safe guards.
  - CLI: Postinstall CI detection message standardized; CLI install tests pass.
  - Monorepo: yarn test runs across workspaces; SDK has no tests but exits 0.
- CI pipeline (Completed)
  - Added .github/workflows/ci.yml with Node (Yarn 4) and Python (pytest) jobs.
  - CI now uploads coverage and JUnit artifacts for Node (CLI/Web/SDK) and Python core.
  - Added quantum test subset JUnit artifact to track quantum routing health.
- ESLint (Completed)
  - Root flat eslint.config.js to address v9 migration warnings; excludes web (Next-managed lint).
  - Flat configs for CLI and SDK with @typescript-eslint; lint scripts updated for TS.

#### Next Steps (updated, prioritized)

P0 (Quality gates & reliability)
- Enforce coverage thresholds in CI:
  - Jest: Configure coverageThreshold in web/cli to prevent regressions.
  - Pytest: Add --cov-fail-under baseline in Python core when metrics stabilize.
- CI annotations:
  - Add a GitHub summary step (e.g., dorny/test-reporter) to render uploaded JUnit files for quick triage.
- Flakiness watch:
  - Introduce a retry-once strategy in CI for known flaky suites (if any emerge) with reporting.

P1 (Quantum & metrics hardening)
- Quantum metrics baseline:
  - Extend core tests to output performance metrics; archive artifacts per run for time-series trend analysis.
  - Define SLOs for quantum routing latency and success rates; alert on regressions (GitHub PR checks).
- Expand Python tests:
  - Add integration tests covering router_integration and collapse strategies under load-mocked scenarios.

P1 (Product & security backlog)
- Backend cookie auth parity:
  - Complete server-side httpOnly cookie handling and component migration to new auth system (as tracked in roadmap).
- Stripe integration & dashboard:
  - Progress web Stripe flows and user dashboard features (payments, usage, API keys).

P2 (DX & docs)
- Add JUnit and coverage badges in README/docs.
- Add contributor guide for running tests locally and interpreting CI artifacts.
- Improve Next ESLint rules in web once flat-config compatibility is confirmed.

#### Previous Development Tasks (Now Lower Priority)

These tasks should be addressed AFTER completing Phase 1.7 critical gaps:

1) P0 Testing and CI gate
   - Add test runner to web (Jest + @testing-library/react or Vitest) and provide "test" script.
   - Fix CLI postinstall CI-mode path: either log "CI environment detected" when process.env.CI is set or update the test to assert the new output, while still verifying no network calls.
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow to run lint/tests for all workspaces (yarn workspaces foreach -A) and pytest for packages/core; block merges on red.

2) P0 ESLint v9 migration
   - Add eslint.config.js to root, packages/cli, and packages/sdk (or pin ESLint v8 temporarily).
   - In web, enable @next/eslint-plugin-next in config.

3) P1 Quantum validation
   - Run and stabilize quantum tests in packages/core/tests/quantum (experience_buffer, dqn_agent, training_pipeline) in CI; record baseline metrics.

4) P1 DX hardening
   - Ensure .gitignore includes .next/ and out/ in all relevant paths; add typecheck scripts in web/cli/sdk; ensure scripts don‚Äôt fail when a workspace has no tests.

### Addendum ‚Äì Progress Alignment (2025-08-21)

Recent engineering efforts shifted from net-new feature delivery to operational reliability:

1. Dependency Governance
   - Adopted `pyproject.toml` + `uv` as authoritative Python dependency source
   - Added drift detection script (`scripts/check_python_deps_sync.sh`) ‚Äì pending CI enforcement
2. Context Layer Clarification
   - Active: In-memory `SimpleContextManager` with metrics instrumentation (Prometheus + JSON endpoint)
   - Deferred: Previously claimed DB + semantic search context layer awaiting
      re-validation; removed from "complete" assertions elsewhere
3. Observability Expansion
   - New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/context/metrics` (lightweight JSON)
   - Planned: CI pipeline to add coverage gates, drift checks, markdown lint
4. Documentation Enhancements
   - README updated with dependency policy and environment flag usage
5. Upcoming (Next Window)
   - Implement CI GitHub Actions workflow for tests & drift enforcement (P0)
   - Decision record: rebuild advanced context vs. de-scope (P1)
   - Quantum routing instrumentation scaffolding (P1)

Status Snapshot (Aug 21):

| Domain | State | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Core orchestration | Stable | No regressions detected |
| Context (simple) | Functional | Provides conversation continuity only |
| Context (advanced) | Deferred | Semantic/persistent features paused |
| Observability | Improving | Metrics endpoints added; CI pending |
| Dependency hygiene | Baseline | Single-source policy instituted |

Action Items Logged:
- [x] Add CI workflow (tests, lint, drift, coverage) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (2025-10-05)** - Full CI pipeline with Node/Python jobs, coverage thresholds, PR annotations
- [ ] Define scope for advanced context persistence
- [ ] Add quantum routing performance counters (latency, strategy distribution)
- [ ] Draft caching & performance RFC (Phase 2.4 precursor)

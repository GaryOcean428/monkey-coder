## üîÑ Progress Update (2025-08-21)

Recent work focused on tightening operational reliability, observability, and
dependency consistency rather than major feature expansion. A quantum
performance metrics skeleton and enhanced CI gates were initiated.

### Delivered Since 2025-08-19
1. Python Dependency Standardization
   - Adopted `pyproject.toml` + `uv` as authoritative runtime dependency source
   - Added `scripts/check_python_deps_sync.sh` to detect and optionally fix drift with `requirements.txt`
2. Context Observability
   - Added JSON endpoint: `GET /api/v1/context/metrics` (lightweight stats)
   - Metrics refresh hooks integrated into SimpleContextManager (Prometheus gauges/counters)
3. Documentation & Environment
   - README updated with dependency policy & environment flag usage
   - Feature flags documented: `ENABLE_CONTEXT_MANAGER`, `CONTEXT_MODE` (future: model selector, result cache)
4. Branch & Workflow Preparation
   - Created enhancement branch `enhancement/observability-ci` for CI/metrics hardening
   - Planned GitHub Actions workflow (pending) for: uv sync check, pytest, markdownlint, yarn workspace build, drift enforcement
5. Minor API Improvement
   - Added context stats JSON endpoint without requiring Prometheus scraping
6. Foundational Quantum Metrics
   - Added `quantum_performance.py` skeleton (timers + counters stubs)
7. CI Foundations
   - Extended CI with drift check, markdown lint (non-blocking), Python coverage threshold, job dependency graph

### Context Management Status Clarification
Earlier documents referenced a ‚Äúfull database & semantic search‚Äù implementation.
Current live system (Aug 21) uses the in-memory SimpleContextManager with
instrumentation. Advanced persistent layer + embeddings are deferred and will be
re-scoped under upcoming performance / data durability initiatives. Roadmap
bullets updated to reflect this.

### Updated Production Readiness Assessment

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Core Execution (orchestrator, routing, quantum base) | ‚úÖ Stable | No regressions detected |
| Context (simple) | ‚úÖ Functional | In-memory only; persistence deferred |
| Context (advanced) | üü° Deferred | DB + semantic search to be revalidated |
| Observability | üü° Improving | New JSON metrics; CI pipeline pending |
| Dependency Hygiene | ‚úÖ Baseline | Drift script in place; CI enforcement pending |
| Quantum Advanced Phases (2.2‚Äì2.4) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Monitoring / caching not started |

### Near-Term (Next 5‚Äì7 Days) - Updated 2025-10-05

| Priority | Task | Status | Outcome |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| P0 | Add CI workflow (tests, lint, drift check) | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | All 6 GitHub Actions workflows operational |
| P0 | Railway deployment enhancement | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | Phase 1 & 2 complete with comprehensive tooling |
| P0 | Security hardening (subprocess vulnerabilities) | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | All shell=True usage eliminated (PR #126) |
| P1 | Phase 3: CI/CD Railway integration | üìã READY | Prerequisites met, ready to implement |
| P1 | Quantum performance instrumentation | üìã PLANNED | Latency, collapse strategy stats |
| P2 | Caching layer design (routing/model selection) | üìã PLANNED | Draft spec feeding Phase 2.4 |

### Newly Logged Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Dual dependency sources may drift | Medium | CI drift check (planned) + single-source policy enforced |
| Advanced context claims vs reality | Reputational | Clarified status; future scope redefinition |
| Missing CI gates delays regression detection | High | Prioritized as P0 task |

### Action Items Recorded
- [ ] Implement CI workflow (uv + yarn + lint + drift)
- [ ] Decide on markdown lint compliance vs selective ignore
- [ ] Scope advanced context persistence (design doc or retire claim)
- [ ] Add quantum performance metrics collector skeleton
- [ ] Introduce caching RFC (Phase 2.4 groundwork)

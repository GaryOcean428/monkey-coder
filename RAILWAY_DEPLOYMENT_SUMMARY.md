## Railway Deployment Checklist

Based on the Railway Deployment Master Cheat Sheet:

### Build System (Issue 1)
- [ ] Only railpack.json exists (no competing build files)
- [ ] railpack.json has valid JSON syntax
- [ ] Required fields are present (version, metadata, build, deploy)

### PORT Binding (Issue 2)  
- [ ] Application uses process.env.PORT (not hardcoded ports)
- [ ] Application binds to 0.0.0.0 (not localhost/127.0.0.1)
- [ ] Start command doesn't hardcode ports

### Health Checks (Issue 5)
- [ ] Health endpoint implemented (/health returning 200)
- [ ] healthCheckPath configured in railpack.json
- [ ] Health check timeout set appropriately (300s recommended)

### Reference Variables (Issue 4)
- [ ] Use RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN not PORT references
- [ ] Use RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN for internal communication
- [ ] No invalid variable references in configuration

### Monorepo Structure (Issue 6)
- [ ] Services properly configured if monorepo
- [ ] No conflicting service configurations
- [ ] Clear separation of service concerns

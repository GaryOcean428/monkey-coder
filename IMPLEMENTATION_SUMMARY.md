# Railway Deployment Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Railway deployment fixes for the monkey-coder repository based on the critical issues identified in the deployment checklist.

## Issues Addressed

### ðŸ”´ Priority 0 (Blocking) Issues - ALL FIXED

#### 1. Root railpack wrong provider
**Status:** âœ… FIXED  
**Issue:** Root railpack.json was using Node.js provider with static file serving, but production needs Python FastAPI server that serves both API and static files.

**Solution:**
- Changed provider from `node` to `python`
- Added both Python 3.12 and Node.js 20 to support hybrid deployment
- Changed start command to use `run_server.py` (unified deployment)
- `run_server.py` serves FastAPI backend and mounts static frontend files

**Files Changed:**
- `/railpack.json`

**Verification:**
```bash
jq '.provider, .packages, .deploy.startCommand' railpack.json
# Output:
# "python"
# {"python": "3.12", "node": "20"}
# "/app/.venv/bin/python run_server.py"
```

#### 2. Requirements.txt path mismatch
**Status:** âœ… FIXED  
**Issue:** Backend and ML services referenced `requirements.txt` without absolute path, relying on Railway's build directory context which could be fragile.

**Solution:**
- Updated all railpack.json files to use absolute path `/app/requirements.txt`
- Ensures consistent requirements resolution regardless of build context

**Files Changed:**
- `/railpack.json`
- `/services/backend/railpack.json`
- `/services/ml/railpack.json`

**Verification:**
```bash
grep -r "requirements.txt" */railpack.json services/*/railpack.json
# All paths now use: /app/requirements.txt
```

#### 3. ML service start command broken
**Status:** âœ… FIXED  
**Issue:** Start command used `services.ml.ml_server:app` which doesn't work because Python cannot import `services.ml` as a module from `/app`.

**Solution:**
- Changed start command to: `cd /app/services/ml && /app/.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn ml_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- This changes to the ML service directory before running uvicorn
- `ml_server:app` correctly references the local `ml_server.py` file

**Files Changed:**
- `/services/ml/railpack.json`

**Verification:**
```bash
jq -r '.deploy.startCommand' services/ml/railpack.json
# Output: cd /app/services/ml && /app/.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn ml_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Priority 1 (High) Issues - ALL FIXED

#### 4. Python version inconsistency
**Status:** âœ… FIXED  
**Issue:** Mixed Python versions (3.11, 3.12, 3.13) across services and configurations.

**Solution:**
- Standardized on Python 3.12 across all services
- Updated sandbox Dockerfile from Python 3.11 to 3.12
- Added `.python-version` files for backend and ML services
- `pyproject.toml` already specified `requires-python = ">=3.12"`

**Files Changed:**
- `/services/sandbox/Dockerfile` (3.11 â†’ 3.12)
- `/services/backend/.python-version` (new file: `3.12`)
- `/services/ml/.python-version` (new file: `3.12`)

**Verification:**
```bash
# All railpack.json files specify Python 3.12
jq '.packages.python' railpack.json services/*/railpack.json
# All output: "3.12"

# Sandbox Dockerfile uses Python 3.12
grep "FROM python" services/sandbox/Dockerfile
# Output: FROM python:3.12-slim

# .python-version files exist
cat services/backend/.python-version services/ml/.python-version
# Both output: 3.12
```

#### 5. PYTHONPATH missing core path
**Status:** âœ… FIXED  
**Issue:** ML service PYTHONPATH didn't include `/app/packages/core`, causing import failures for `monkey_coder` package.

**Solution:**
- Updated ML service PYTHONPATH to: `/app:/app/packages/core:/app/services/ml`
- Backend service already had correct PYTHONPATH: `/app:/app/packages/core`

**Files Changed:**
- `/services/ml/railpack.json`

**Verification:**
```bash
jq -r '.deploy.variables.PYTHONPATH' services/ml/railpack.json
# Output: /app:/app/packages/core:/app/services/ml

jq -r '.deploy.variables.PYTHONPATH' services/backend/railpack.json
# Output: /app:/app/packages/core
```

## Additional Improvements

### Health Check Configuration
Added proper health check configuration to all services:

| Service | Health Check Path | Timeout | Restart Policy |
|---------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| Root (unified) | `/health` | 300s | ON_FAILURE |
| Backend | `/api/health` | 120s | ON_FAILURE |
| ML | `/api/health` | 120s | ON_FAILURE |

**Why this matters:**
- Railway uses health checks to determine service availability
- Proper timeouts prevent false failures during startup
- Restart policies ensure automatic recovery from transient failures

### Documentation
Created comprehensive deployment verification guide:
- Pre-deployment validation checklist
- Post-deployment testing commands
- Railway Dashboard configuration examples
- Common issues and solutions
- Success criteria

**File:** `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md`

## Testing & Validation

### JSON Validation
All railpack.json files validated as proper JSON:
```bash
âœ… Root railpack.json is valid JSON
âœ… Backend railpack.json is valid JSON
âœ… ML railpack.json is valid JSON
```

### Health Endpoint Verification
Confirmed health endpoints exist in code:
```bash
# Root/Backend service (main.py)
@app.get("/health", response_model=HealthResponse)
@app.get("/api/health", response_model=HealthResponse)

# ML service (ml_server.py)
@app.get("/health")
@app.get("/api/health")
```

### File Structure Verification
All critical files verified to exist:
```bash
âœ… run_server.py exists
âœ… requirements.txt exists at root
âœ… ml_server.py exists
âœ… monkey_coder.app package exists
âœ… packages/web/out directory configured
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Unified Root Deployment (Recommended)
The root service now uses `run_server.py` for unified deployment:
1. Installs Python dependencies
2. Installs Node.js dependencies and builds frontend
3. Runs single Python server that:
   - Serves FastAPI backend on configured port
   - Mounts static frontend files from `packages/web/out`
   - Provides health checks at `/health` and `/api/health`

### Separate Backend & ML Services
Backend and ML services remain independent:
- Backend: FastAPI API for core orchestration
- ML: FastAPI service for ML inference workloads
- Both can communicate via Railway private domains

### Service Communication
Services use Railway's service reference syntax:
```bash
# Backend references ML service
ML_SERVICE_URL=http://${{monkey-coder-ml.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}

# Frontend references backend
VITE_API_URL=https://${{monkey-coder-backend.RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}
```

## Migration from Old Configuration

### Before (Broken)
```json
// Root: Node.js static file server only
{
  "provider": "node",
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node packages/serve/bin/serve.js -s packages/web/out -l $PORT"
  }
}

// ML: Broken module path
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python -m uvicorn services.ml.ml_server:app"
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```json
// Root: Python unified server
{
  "provider": "python",
  "packages": {"python": "3.12", "node": "20"},
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "/app/.venv/bin/python run_server.py",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}

// ML: Correct module path with cd
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd /app/services/ml && python -m uvicorn ml_server:app",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### No Security Issues Introduced
- âœ… CodeQL analysis: No issues detected
- âœ… Code review: No comments
- âœ… Configuration files only (no code changes)
- âœ… All paths use absolute references
- âœ… No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Security Best Practices Maintained
- Virtual environments isolated at `/app/.venv`
- Environment variables used for all secrets
- Health checks prevent information leakage
- Restart policies limit exposure during failures

## Success Criteria

All success criteria met:
- âœ… Root service uses Python provider with unified deployment
- âœ… All requirements.txt paths use absolute `/app/requirements.txt`
- âœ… ML service start command fixed with proper cd
- âœ… Python version standardized to 3.12
- âœ… PYTHONPATH includes necessary paths for imports
- âœ… Health checks configured on all services
- âœ… Restart policies configured on all services
- âœ… All JSON configurations validated
- âœ… Documentation created for deployment verification
- âœ… No security issues introduced

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Push changes to Railway:**
   - Changes are in branch: `copilot/fix-railway-deployment-issues`
   - Merge to main branch when ready

2. **Deploy services in order:**
   - ML service first (no dependencies)
   - Backend service second (depends on ML)
   - Root service last (unified deployment)

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check all health endpoints return 200 OK
   - Verify frontend is served at root URL
   - Test API endpoints
   - Check service logs for errors

4. **Monitor:**
   - Watch Railway deployment logs
   - Verify all services show as healthy
   - Test inter-service communication

## Conclusion

All critical Railway deployment issues have been successfully fixed:
- âœ… 3 Priority 0 (Blocking) issues resolved
- âœ… 2 Priority 1 (High) issues resolved
- âœ… Additional improvements to health checks and restart policies
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation created
- âœ… All configurations validated
- âœ… No security issues introduced

The repository is now ready for Railway deployment with the fixed configurations.

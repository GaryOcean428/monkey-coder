# Railway Deployment Fix Summary - January 28, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **NameError: name 'logger' is not defined** in monitoring.py

**Error:**

```
File "/app/monkey_coder/monitoring.py", line 21, in <module>
    logger.warning("Prometheus client not available. Metrics export disabled.")
    ^^^^^^
NameError: name 'logger' is not defined
```

**Root Cause:**
- Railway was using root `requirements.txt` which only contained ML dependencies
- Missing `prometheus-client` package caused import to fail
- This led to logger warning being called before logger was initialized

**Fix:**
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include all dependencies from `packages/core/pyproject.toml`
- Added `prometheus-client>=0.19.0` and all other core API dependencies

### 2. **CLI Chat Command 422 Unprocessable Entity Error**

**Error:**

```
Error: Request failed with status code 422
Unprocessable Entity: {"detail":[{"type":"literal_error","loc":["body","superclause_config","persona"],"msg":"Input should be 'developer'","input":"assistant"}]}
```

**Root Cause:**
- CLI was sending persona type "assistant" which is not a valid PersonaType
- TypeScript types included "chat" as a task_type which backend doesn't support

**Fix:**
- Changed default persona in CLI from 'assistant' to 'developer'
- Removed 'chat' from task_type union in TypeScript types

## Files Modified

1. **requirements.txt**
   - Added all core dependencies from pyproject.toml
   - Includes: FastAPI, uvicorn, prometheus-client, and 40+ other packages

2. **packages/cli/src/cli.ts**
   - Changed `.option('-p, --persona <persona>', 'AI persona to use', 'assistant')`
   - To: `.option('-p, --persona <persona>', 'AI persona to use', 'developer')`

3. **packages/cli/src/types.ts**
   - Removed 'chat' from task_type union
   - Now only includes valid types: code_generation, code_analysis, etc.

4. **docs/roadmap.md**
   - Updated with completion of these fixes
   - Added to completed tasks table

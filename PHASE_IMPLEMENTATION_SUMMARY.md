# üöÄ Phase Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 - Package Namespace Cleanup (P0)
1. **Fixed package references**:
   - Replaced all `@monkey-coder/cli` references with `monkey-coder-cli`
   - No `@aetheros/monkey-coder` references found
   - Updated 14 files across docs, scripts, and tests

2. **Registry configuration**:
   - Created `.npmrc` file to lock registry to `https://registry.npmjs.org/`
   - Ran `yarn install` to update lockfile with new package names

### ‚úÖ Phase 2 - CLI Setup & Testing (P1)
1. **CLI Configuration**:
   - CLI already installed globally: `monkey-coder-cli@1.0.1`
   - Configured base URL: `https://monkey-coder.up.railway.app`
   - Set API key: `mk-dev-EeSR4-BBpJsUTZCgIUjbdN3-_WoUIcgvyFn1VU6iKWU`

2. **Health Check Results**:
   - ‚úÖ Server is healthy (Version: 1.0.0)
   - ‚úÖ All components active: orchestrator, quantum_executor, persona_router, provider_registry

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 3 - Railway Service Diagnostics (P1)
1. **API Issues Found**:
   - ‚ùå `/api/v1/models` returns 404 (incorrect path)
   - ‚ùå `/v1/models` returns 500 "Failed to list models"
   - ‚ùå `/v1/billing/usage` returns 500 "Failed to retrieve usage metrics"
   - **NOT 402 errors** - these are 500 server errors

2. **Root Cause**: The 500 errors suggest missing environment variables or provider initialization issues on Railway, not payment/billing problems.

### ‚úÖ Phase 4 - Postinstall Script Review (P2)
1. **Good News**: The postinstall script is already well-designed:
   - Has CI detection (skips in CI environments)
   - Makes NO network calls
   - Only creates local config directories
   - Has proper error handling
   - **No changes needed**

### ‚úÖ Provider Consolidation
1. **Updated Groq Provider**:
   - Added `qwen/qwen3-32b` model support
   - Added `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` model support
   - Both models now available through Groq's hardware-accelerated infrastructure

## Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Railway Deployment Errors
The 500 errors indicate server-side issues:
- Missing or misconfigured API keys for providers
- Provider initialization failures
- Need to check Railway environment variables

### 2. Model Provider Cleanup
Next steps:
- Update routing logic to use Groq for Qwen/Kimi models
- Consider deprecating standalone `qwen_adapter.py` and `moonshot_provider.py`
- Update model registry to reflect Groq as the provider

## Recommendations

1. **Check Railway Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   railway variables | grep -E "GROQ_API_KEY|OPENAI_API_KEY|ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
   ```

2. **Review Railway Logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs -s monkey-coder --json | jq '.[] | select(.level == "ERROR")'
   ```

3. **Test Provider Initialization Locally**:
   ```python
   from monkey_coder.providers import GroqProvider
   provider = GroqProvider()
   models = provider.get_available_models()
   ```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Package namespace issues resolved** - All references updated to `monkey-coder-cli`
‚úÖ **CLI properly configured** - Can communicate with Railway deployment
‚úÖ **Postinstall script is safe** - No changes needed
‚úÖ **Groq provider updated** - Now supports Qwen3-32B and Kimi-K2-Instruct
‚ùå **Railway API errors** - 500 errors need investigation (not 402 payment issues)

The main remaining issue is the 500 errors from the Railway deployment, which appear to be configuration/initialization related rather than billing/payment issues.

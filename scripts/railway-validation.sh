Generated: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

## Service Configuration
- Base URL: $BASE_URL
- Health Check Path: $HEALTH_PATH

## Environment Variables Status
$(if command -v railway >/dev/null 2>&1; then railway vars | head -20 | sed 's/^/- /'; else echo "- Railway CLI not available"; fi)

## Recent Error Patterns
\`\`\`
$(grep -E "(502|503|500|ERROR|FATAL)" "$LOG_DIR/railway-recent-logs.log" 2>/dev/null | tail -10 || echo "No recent errors found")
\`\`\`

## Health Endpoint Response
\`\`\`
$(grep -A 10 "< HTTP" "$LOG_DIR/health-GET-test.log" 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "Health endpoint not responding")
\`\`\`

## Recommended Actions
1. **If 502/503 errors**: Check railway-recent-logs.log for service crashes
2. **If environment issues**: Verify all required variables are set with 'railway vars'
3. **If health check fails**: Check railpack.json configuration and service startup
4. **If database issues**: Verify DATABASE_URL and connection permissions

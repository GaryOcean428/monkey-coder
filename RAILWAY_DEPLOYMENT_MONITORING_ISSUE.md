# Railway Deployment Monitoring Implementation - Issue #63

**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Labels**: deployment, monitoring, railway  

## Summary

Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the monkey-coder Railway deployment to ensure production stability and early detection of issues.

## Background

Following the Railway deployment failure resolution, we need robust monitoring to prevent future deployment issues and ensure system reliability in production.

## Requirements

### 1. Health Check Monitoring
- [ ] Configure Railway health check alerts
- [ ] Set up response time monitoring (target: <5s)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage (alert at >80% of allocated)
- [ ] Track CPU utilization patterns

### 2. Application Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Implement request/response time tracking
- [ ] Monitor external API call performance
- [ ] Track error rates and patterns
- [ ] Set up database query performance monitoring

### 3. Error Tracking & Alerting
- [ ] Configure Sentry for error aggregation
- [ ] Set up Railway log-based alerts
- [ ] Implement custom error rate thresholds
- [ ] Create escalation procedures for critical issues

### 4. Deployment Verification
- [ ] Automated post-deployment health checks
- [ ] API endpoint validation tests
- [ ] Frontend asset availability checks
- [ ] Database connectivity verification

### 5. Infrastructure Monitoring
- [ ] Railway service uptime tracking
- [ ] Network latency monitoring
- [ ] SSL certificate expiration alerts
- [ ] Domain resolution monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Health Check Enhancements
```python
# Enhanced health check with detailed metrics
@app.get("/health/detailed")
async def detailed_health_check():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "metrics": {
            "memory_mb": get_memory_usage(),
            "cpu_percent": get_cpu_usage(),
            "active_connections": get_active_connections(),
            "response_time_ms": measure_response_time()
        },
        "components": {
            "database": check_database_health(),
            "redis": check_redis_health(),
            "external_apis": check_api_health()
        }
    }
```

### Railway Configuration
```json
{
  "healthCheckPath": "/health",
  "healthCheckTimeout": 30,
  "healthCheckInterval": 60,
  "alerts": {
    "healthCheckFailures": 3,
    "responseTimeThreshold": 5000,
    "memoryThreshold": 80
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `/health` - Basic health check (existing)
- `/health/detailed` - Comprehensive metrics
- `/health/readiness` - Kubernetes-style readiness probe
- `/metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero Downtime Deployments**
   - Deployment success rate: 100%
   - Rollback capability within 5 minutes
   - Automated deployment verification

2. **Performance Targets**
   - API response time: <500ms (95th percentile)
   - Health check response: <100ms
   - Memory usage: <70% of allocated

3. **Alert Response**
   - Critical alerts: <5 minutes notification
   - Health check failures: <1 minute detection
   - Error rate threshold: >1% over 5 minutes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Monitoring (Week 1)
- [ ] Configure Railway health checks
- [ ] Set up Sentry error tracking
- [ ] Implement basic performance logging

### Phase 2: Advanced Metrics (Week 2)
- [ ] Add detailed health endpoints
- [ ] Configure custom Railway alerts
- [ ] Implement response time tracking

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Monitoring (Week 3)
- [ ] Full metrics dashboard
- [ ] Automated deployment verification
- [ ] Performance optimization based on metrics

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Sentry Configuration
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1

# Monitoring Configuration
ENABLE_METRICS=true
METRICS_ENDPOINT=true
HEALTH_CHECK_DETAILED=true
PERFORMANCE_LOGGING=true

# Alert Thresholds
MEMORY_ALERT_THRESHOLD=80
CPU_ALERT_THRESHOLD=85
RESPONSE_TIME_THRESHOLD=5000
ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD=1.0
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Load Testing**
   - Simulate production traffic patterns
   - Test health check reliability under load
   - Validate alert thresholds

2. **Failure Simulation**
   - Database connection failures
   - High memory usage scenarios
   - API endpoint timeouts

3. **Alert Validation**
   - Test all alert conditions
   - Verify notification delivery
   - Validate escalation procedures

## Dependencies

- Railway platform monitoring features
- Sentry error tracking service
- Custom logging implementation
- Health check endpoint enhancements

- Error Handling Improvements (#65)

## Notes

This monitoring implementation should be prioritized after the immediate deployment fixes are confirmed working in production. The goal is to establish proactive monitoring that prevents issues rather than just reacting to them.

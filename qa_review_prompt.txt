Perform a comprehensive QA review of the Monkey Coder codebase and provide a detailed report:

1. Code Quality Analysis:
   - Review the Google provider implementation (packages/core/monkey_coder/providers/google_adapter.py)
   - Check for proper error handling, logging, and type hints
   - Verify the new google.genai vs google-generativeai dual API support
   - Check for any security vulnerabilities or performance issues
   - Verify async/await patterns are correctly implemented

2. Model Compliance Check:
   - Verify all models in google_adapter.py match the official Gemini 2.5 series
   - Check that model mappings are correct
   - Ensure deprecated models are properly handled
   - Validate model version handling (new API vs legacy)

3. Roadmap Validation:
   - Review phase-1-7-critical-gaps.md claims vs reality
   - The document claims 95% completion - verify this is accurate
   - Check if AI provider integration is really working
   - Validate quantum features implementation status

4. Configuration Issues:
   - Check pyproject.toml dependencies are correct
   - Verify google-genai vs google-generativeai package handling
   - Check for any version conflicts or missing dependencies
   - Validate environment variable usage

5. Integration Testing:
   - Does the test_google_integration.py script work correctly?
   - Are both API versions properly tested?
   - Is error handling comprehensive?

Please provide specific issues found with line numbers and recommended fixes.

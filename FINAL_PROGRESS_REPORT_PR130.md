---

## ❌ Remaining Tasks (Optional/Future Phases)

### High Priority (Recommended for Phase 4)
- [ ] **CI/CD Full Validation**: Run complete GitHub Actions pipeline on PR to verify all checks pass in CI environment
- [ ] **Model Naming Tests**: Investigate and fix 3 non-critical model naming assertion failures
  - Location: `tests/quantum/test_dqn_agent.py` and `tests/test_models_registry.py`
  - Impact: Non-blocking, cosmetic test assertion issues
- [ ] **Python Test Coverage**: Review 9 skipped tests and determine enablement strategy

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
- [ ] **Documentation Propagation**: Consider adding Railway standards to additional guide files
- [ ] **Pre-commit Enhancements**: Add automated Python syntax validation hooks
- [ ] **MCP Integration Testing**: Validate enhanced Railway tools in live environment

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
- [ ] **React Test Warnings**: Address act() wrapping warnings in FormStatus component tests
- [ ] **Linting Cleanup**: Address 21 non-blocking TypeScript warnings ('any' types)
- [ ] **TypeScript Improvements**: Replace remaining 'any' types with proper type definitions

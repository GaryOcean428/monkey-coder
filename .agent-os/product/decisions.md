## 2025-01-29: Build Tool Strategy and Yarn Workspace Retention

**ID:** DEC-007
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Infrastructure
**Stakeholders:** Engineering Team, DevOps, Tech Lead

### Decision

Continue using Yarn 4.9.2 workspace configuration as the primary build and package management system, with targeted enhancements rather than migrating to Nx, Bazel, or Pants. Implement specific improvements to task orchestration, build monitoring, TypeScript project references, and Python integration within the existing Yarn ecosystem.

### Context

Following the completion of Phase 1 system enhancements and the establishment of a stable Railway deployment, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted to determine whether the project should migrate from Yarn workspaces to more advanced build systems like Nx (JavaScript-first monorepo), Bazel/Pants (polyglot hermetic builds), or maintain the current setup with improvements.

**Current State:**
- 4 workspace packages: cli (TypeScript), core (Python), sdk (TypeScript+Python), web (Next.js)
- Yarn 4.9.2 with global cache and hardlinks achieving 30-50% faster installs
- Comprehensive constraint enforcement via yarn.config.cjs
- Optimized Railway deployment with railpack.json
- Small-to-medium development team
- Build times: ~2-3 minutes full build, ~10-20 seconds incremental TypeScript

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Applied decision matrix for Yarn vs Nx vs Bazel/Pants across signals:
- Shared UI/libs coupling: Medium (some type sharing between CLI and Web)
- Developer experience priority: High (team velocity critical)
- Mixed language complexity: High (TypeScript + Python core)
- CI scale/remote caching: Low-Medium (current infrastructure sufficient)
- Build determinism: Medium (Railway handles reproducibility)
- Migration friction: High for any migration
- Ecosystem maturity: JS-heavy with Python services

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Migrate to Nx 21**
   - Pros: Project graph intelligence, better task orchestration, terminal UI, enhanced caching, continuous tasks mode
   - Cons: 3-4 week migration effort, learning curve, Python integration complexity, Railway deployment changes, added configuration overhead
   - Score: 7/10 - Good features but migration costs too high for current scale

2. **Migrate to Bazel 7+ or Pants**
   - Pros: True hermetic builds, native multi-language support, advanced caching (BwoB), Google-scale capability, Skymeld analysis/execution
   - Cons: 8-12 week migration, steep learning curve, developer experience degradation, opaque errors, rules_python still evolving, WORKSPACE→Bzlmod transition, Railway incompatibility
   - Score: 5/10 - Massive overkill for 4-package monorepo

3. **Hybrid Approach (Nx for Frontend + Yarn for Python)**
   - Pros: Leverages Nx for frontend optimization
   - Cons: Two build systems to maintain, cognitive load, unclear boundaries
   - Score: 4/10 - Complexity without clear benefits

4. **Turborepo as Lighter Alternative**
   - Pros: Simpler than Nx, good caching, less invasive
   - Cons: Still requires migration, limited Python integration
   - Score: 6/10 - Interesting but not compelling

5. **Continue with Yarn + Targeted Improvements (Selected)**
   - Pros: Zero migration effort, proven configuration, team familiarity, Railway compatibility, ~10 days implementation for enhancements
   - Cons: Manual dependency tracking, limited build optimization, no remote caching, no project graph
   - Score: 8.5/10 - Best ROI and risk profile

### Rationale

## 2025-10-05: Railway Deployment Standards & Best Practices

**ID:** DEC-008
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Infrastructure / DevOps
**Stakeholders:** DevOps, Tech Lead, All Contributors

### Decision

Establish and enforce comprehensive Railway deployment standards to prevent recurring deployment failures and ensure consistent configuration across all services. These standards codify lessons learned from PR #126 (security hardening) and PR #128 (Railway debugging tools).

### Context

Previous Railway deployments encountered recurring issues:
- Build system conflicts (multiple competing config files)
- PORT binding failures (hardcoded ports, wrong host)
- Missing health check endpoints
- Incorrect service reference patterns
- Security vulnerabilities (shell=True in subprocess calls)

PR #126 and #128 resolved these issues through systematic validation and tooling. This decision formalizes those solutions as mandatory standards.

### Standards Implementation

#### 1. Build Configuration
**Mandatory:**
- Single `railpack.json` as primary build configuration
- No competing files (Dockerfile, railway.toml, nixpacks.toml) at root
- Valid JSON syntax enforced by pre-commit validation

**Rationale:** Railway's build priority causes conflicts when multiple configs exist.

#### 2. PORT Binding
**Mandatory:**
- Use `process.env.PORT` for port configuration
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` (not localhost or 127.0.0.1)
- No hardcoded port values

**Rationale:** Railway injects PORT dynamically; localhost binding prevents external access.

#### 3. Health Checks
**Mandatory:**
- Implement `/api/health` endpoint returning 200 status
- Configure in railpack.json with appropriate timeout
- Return JSON with status information

**Rationale:** Railway requires health checks for deployment validation and monitoring.

#### 4. Service References
**Mandatory:**
- Use `${{service.RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}` for external references
- Use `${{service.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}` for internal references
- Never reference `${{service.PORT}}` (not available)

**Rationale:** Railway provides domain variables, not PORT variables between services.

#### 5. Security
**Mandatory:**
- No `shell=True` in subprocess calls
- Input validation for all external data
- Path sanitization for file operations

**Rationale:** Security vulnerabilities resolved in PR #126 must remain fixed.

### Validation & Enforcement

**Automated Tools:**
```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
./scripts/railway-deployment-integration.sh

# Configuration validation
./scripts/validate-railway-config.sh

# MCP-enhanced debugging
python scripts/railway-mcp-debug.py

# Quick readiness check
./check-railway-readiness.sh
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- GitHub Actions workflow validates Railway configs on all PRs
- Pre-commit hooks check railpack.json syntax
- Automated smoke tests verify health endpoints

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ 100% Railway deployment success rate (3/3 services)
- ✅ Zero build system conflicts
- ✅ Consistent configuration patterns across all services
- ✅ Comprehensive validation catches issues pre-deployment
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities systematically prevented
- ✅ Clear documentation and standards for all contributors
- ✅ Reduced debugging time (tools + documentation)

**Negative:**
- Additional validation steps in deployment process
- Learning curve for new contributors
- Maintenance overhead for validation scripts
- Potential false positives from strict validation

### Results Achieved

**From PR #126:**
- ✅ All subprocess security vulnerabilities eliminated
- ✅ 234/234 tests passing with enhanced security
- ✅ Comprehensive security audit documented

**From PR #128:**
- ✅ Railway debug tools suite created (4 tools)

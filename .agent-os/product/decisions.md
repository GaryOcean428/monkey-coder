## 2025-01-29: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Monkey Coder will be positioned as an advanced AI-powered CLI development toolkit that leverages quantum computing principles and intelligent model routing to provide superior development assistance compared to existing tools like Claude Code CLI and Gemini CLI. The platform will target professional developers and development teams who need sophisticated, context-aware AI assistance for complex coding challenges.

### Context

The AI development tools market is rapidly evolving with tools like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and GitHub Copilot gaining significant adoption. However, current solutions have limitations in model selection intelligence, context awareness, and handling of complex multi-step development tasks. There's a clear market opportunity for a more advanced tool that uses quantum computing principles and intelligent routing to provide better results.

### Alternatives Considered

   - Pros: Faster to market, simpler architecture, lower development cost
   - Cons: Commoditized market, limited differentiation, lower value proposition

2. **Web-Only AI Development Platform**
   - Pros: Easier user onboarding, visual interface, easier monetization
   - Cons: Developer preference for CLI tools, integration challenges, limited terminal workflow

3. **IDE Plugin Approach**
   - Pros: Integrated development experience, existing user base
   - Cons: Platform dependency, limited reach, constrained by IDE capabilities

### Rationale

The CLI approach with advanced AI routing provides the best combination of:
- **Developer Preference:** CLI tools align with developer workflows and preferences
- **Technical Differentiation:** Quantum routing and multi-agent orchestration create defensible competitive advantages

## 2025-01-29: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Backend Team, DevOps

### Decision

Adopt a hybrid Node.js/Python architecture with TypeScript CLI, Python FastAPI backend, and Railway deployment infrastructure. This combination provides optimal performance for AI workloads while maintaining developer-friendly CLI experience.

### Context

Need to balance CLI performance, AI/ML capabilities, deployment simplicity, and team expertise. The quantum routing engine requires sophisticated mathematical computations best handled in Python, while CLI experience benefits from Node.js ecosystem.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure Python Stack**
   - Pros: Unified language, excellent AI/ML libraries, quantum computing support
   - Cons: Slower CLI startup, less polished CLI tooling, packaging complexity

2. **Pure Node.js Stack**
   - Pros: Fast CLI startup, excellent CLI tooling, unified language
   - Cons: Limited AI/ML ecosystem, quantum computing library limitations

### Rationale

Hybrid approach leverages strengths of both ecosystems:
- TypeScript/Node.js for responsive CLI experience
- Python for AI/ML processing and quantum algorithms
- Railway for simplified deployment and scaling
- Established patterns in existing codebase

### Consequences

**Positive:**

## 2025-01-29: Single Service Deployment Architecture

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Proposed
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** DevOps, Tech Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Consolidate the current multi-service Railway deployment (frontend + backend) into a single unified service deployment to simplify infrastructure management, reduce costs, and improve development velocity.

### Context

Currently deployed as separate frontend and backend services on Railway. While this provides separation of concerns, it introduces complexity in:
- Service coordination and communication
- Environment variable management across services  
- Deployment orchestration and rollbacks
- Cost optimization (multiple service instances)
- Development workflow complexity

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Separate Services**
   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns, independent scaling, fault isolation
   - Cons: Higher complexity, increased costs, deployment coordination challenges

2. **Monolithic Single Container**
   - Pros: Simplest deployment, single point of management, cost-effective
   - Cons: Less flexibility for independent scaling of components

3. **Hybrid Approach with FastAPI Static Serving**
   - Pros: Single service with optimal performance, unified deployment, cost-effective
   - Cons: Requires FastAPI configuration for static file serving

### Rationale

Single service deployment provides optimal balance of:
- **Simplified Operations:** Single deployment pipeline and service management
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduced Railway service costs and resource utilization
- **Development Velocity:** Faster iteration cycles and simplified local development
- **Architecture Alignment:** Matches the CLI-centric nature of the product

### Implementation Options

**Option A: FastAPI + Static Files**
- Serve Next.js build output via FastAPI static file serving
- Single Python container with built frontend assets
- Unified health checks and monitoring

**Option B: Node.js Proxy Architecture**  
- Node.js server proxying Python FastAPI backend
- Single Node container running both frontend and backend coordination
- Maintains TypeScript ecosystem benefits

**Option C: Multi-stage Docker Build**
- Build Next.js frontend in Node stage
- Copy static assets to Python FastAPI stage
- Single container with both components optimized

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reduced Railway service costs (single vs multiple services)
- Simplified deployment and rollback procedures
- Unified environment configuration and secrets management
- Faster development iteration and testing cycles
- Single health check and monitoring endpoint

**Negative:**
- Less granular scaling options for frontend vs backend
- Potential resource contention between components
- Requires architectural changes to current deployment setup
- Single point of failure for both frontend and backend components

## 2025-01-29: Railway Deployment Resolution

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** DevOps, Tech Lead

### Decision

Successfully resolved all critical Railway deployment failures and implemented unified single-service deployment architecture with FastAPI serving Next.js static assets. Consolidated AI model providers and enhanced error handling for production stability.

### Context

Railway deployment was failing with critical startup errors:
- `AttributeError: ProviderType.QWEN` causing immediate application crashes
- Missing frontend build directory `/web/out` preventing static file serving
- Provider enum mismatches preventing proper model routing
- Lack of startup health monitoring and validation

### Implementation

**Provider Model Consolidation:**
- Consolidated Qwen (Alibaba) and Moonshot (Kimi) models under existing GroQ provider
- Eliminated direct QWEN and MOONSHOT enum references that were causing startup failures
- Updated routing capabilities to handle Groq-hosted Qwen and Kimi models
- Added comprehensive provider validation during startup

**Static Asset Resolution:**
- Implemented multi-path fallback system for frontend build directory resolution

**Health Monitoring & Validation:**
- Added component-by-component health checks during application startup
- Implemented startup validation for all provider enum references
- Enhanced logging and monitoring for Railway deployment tracking
- Added graceful error handling that allows partial startup when components fail

### Rationale

This approach provides:
- **Production Stability:** Eliminates critical startup failures that were preventing deployment
- **Simplified Architecture:** Single service reduces deployment complexity and costs
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Better visibility into application health and startup issues
- **Scalable Foundation:** Robust error handling and validation for future development

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Railway deployment now succeeds with zero critical startup errors
- Unified deployment architecture reduces operational complexity
